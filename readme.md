# Hexagonal Grid Layout for React

![Hexagonal Grid Layout Demo](src/assets/hex-grid-layout-demo.png?raw=true "Hexagonal Grid Layout Demo")

---

#### Motivation:

The work of Jesse Breneman [here](https://ninjarockstar.dev/css-hex-grids/).

While reading the article, I thought, "Why not build some react components for this?"

#### Usage:

```
import HexGrids, { HexGridItem, HexGridList } from "react-hex-grids"
...
<HexGridList>
  <HexGridItem>{item1}<HexGridItem>
  ....
</HexGridList>
```

See [examples](/example/src/App.js)
